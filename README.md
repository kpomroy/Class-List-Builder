## Overview
This program automates the creation of class lists for an elementary school, covering grades K-5. It saves teachers and administrators valuable time by generating class lists based on a CSV file containing student information, including fields for first name, last name, grade, and gender. The program divides students by grade and aims to distribute them as evenly as possible across classes, ensuring an equal split between males and females. It then outputs this information to a web page, where the user is able to interact and choose what grade they would like to generate a class list for. The class list and teacher list will be output to the webpage as well as a bar graph showing the distribution of students based on gender within each class. 

## Usage
When running the program, it will prompt the user to provide the name of the CSV file containing student data and a CSV file containing teacher data. Sample testing files named "students.csv" and "teachers.csv" with randomly generated student and teacher data is included in the repository.

## Known Bugs
No known bugs have been reported in the current version of the program.

## Future Work
Future goals of this project include editing the algorithm to work for any number of classes per grade. Another goal is implementing relationships between students that would require them or prevent them from being in class with other specific students who they either get along with or don't get along with.
